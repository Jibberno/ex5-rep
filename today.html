            <h1>The Smiling Man</h1>
            <h2>Feb 28, 2023</h2>
            <p>
                Camping in the middle of Appalachia, I noticed a man from the distance. A man that completely seemed out
                of place for an environment like this. He was well dressed, and looked like he took care of himself. 
                What set me off was noticing his <strong>big</strong> smile that spread across his face. This wasn't no ordinary smile, this smile
                looked like it would hurt the average person if they were to try and do such a thing. But this man was
                doing it for minutes without a look of stress in his eyes.
